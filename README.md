Application of Deep Learning on Healthcare

Abstract

It is estimated that 5 to 10 million people die annually from kidney diseases. Multiple parameters need to be analysed for making diagnosis in patients with renal disorders. An automatic system that would analyse these parameters and provide diagnosis without the help of a specialist would decrease the burden on already overburdened clinicians. Deep learning has already made a huge impact on medical fields like cancer diagnosis and precision medicine and can be applied to build this automated system which can diagnose renal disorders. This study was carried out using the data of nephrology related diseases from ORDBA healthcare dataset and a feed forward neural network was used for the prediction of diseases.
