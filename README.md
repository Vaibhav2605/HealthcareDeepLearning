Application of Deep Learning on Healthcare

Abstract

Multiple parameters need to be analyzed for making diagnosis in patients with renal disorders. An automatic system that would analyze these parameters and provide diagnosis without the help of a specialist would decrease the burden on already overburdened clinicians. Deep learning has already made a huge impact on medical fields like cancer diagnosis and precision medicine and can be applied to build this automated system which can diagnose renal disorders. This study has been carried out using the data of nephrology related diseases extracted from the ORDBA healthcare dataset based on openEHR. A feed forward neural network has been used for the creation of the model that would predict the kidney disease present in the patient based on several parameters.
